# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This starter is provided as-is, without guaranteed support. Community contributions to fix security issues are welcome.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in this project:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. Email the maintainers directly at: **security@${PROJECT_SLUG}.example**
3. Include:
   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Affected version/commit
   - Possible impact

We will acknowledge receipt within 5 business days and provide a timeline for remediation where applicable.

## Scope

- This policy covers the starter repo itself (configuration, Dockerfiles, example code).
- It does not cover projects you build on top of this skeleton â€” those are your responsibility to secure.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please follow responsible disclosure practices. Do not share details publicly until a fix has been published and users have had a reasonable time to update.
