# Epic E6: Docs & Examples

**Goal:** Provide onboarding and usage docs plus an example integration app.

## Scope

- Guides: Getting Started, Testing, OpenAPI usage
- Example Laravel app snippet consuming an adapter
- README polish for package release
- ADR index
- CHANGELOG

## Out of Scope

- Full demo store
- Marketing site

## Deliverables

- [ ] Guides complete
- [ ] Example app snippet (AcmeCart Customer sync)
- [ ] README updated
- [ ] ADR index published
- [ ] CHANGELOG started

## Risks

- Docs falling behind code changes
- Too much detail for MVP (balance depth vs velocity)
