# Plenipotentiary Sandbox

This repository is a **sandbox environment** for developing the [`plenipotentiary-laravel`](packages/plenipotentiary-laravel) package.

The sandbox provides:

- A full Laravel backend app (under `/apps/backend`)
- A frontend app (under `/apps/frontend`)
- Local dev tooling (Docker, devcontainers)
- A place to hand-craft provider/domain/resource adapters before scaffolding is automated

ðŸ“– See [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for project documentation.

## What is `plenipotentiary-laravel`?

An **opinionated Laravel package** that makes it faster and safer to integrate with third-party APIs by:

- Generating provider/domain/resource scaffolding (DTOs, Repositories, Services)
- Handling auth, retries, pagination, idempotency, and error mapping out-of-the-box
- Using a **Generated vs User** split so developers can customise without fear of regeneration overwrites
- Providing contract tests and observability hooks
